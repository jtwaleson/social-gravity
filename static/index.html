                <h1>Social Gravity</h1>
                <p>Social Gravity is a new way to analyze social networks on twitter. I'm sure it could be useful for marketeers and egomaniacs, but more importantly: it's magical.</p>
                <p>If you've read this far, you should follow me on twitter: <a target='_blank' href='http://twitter.com/jtwaleson'>@jtwaleson</a>. After all, I made all this, and it works with twitter</p>
                <h3>How do I ....</h3>
                <p>Click the @ button. Enter a twitter account that is not protected, like @jtwaleson. Leave the settings to default, press Go!</p>
                <p>Your friends will now begin to trickle into the screen. Want to see something cool? Press the start/stop button. Your friends that know eachother will flock together.</p>
                <p>Want to see something even more cool? Use your scroll wheel on the page.<p>
                <p>More? Ok, drag one of your around and see who follows him/her!</p>
                <p>Still more? What about this: press the '?' button. You will see keywords that are being represented in one area.</p>
                <p>No way, there is even more: click a couple of people to see who they are connected to.</p>
                <h3>How did you .....</h3>
                <p>HTML5, AJAX, jQuery, Lots of intelligence, about 20 free evenings spread out over 8 months</p>
                <p>I'd like to thank:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web workers, for relatively smooth UI despite the heavy lifting</li>
                    <li>Javascript/coffeescript/node.js for doing everything</li>
                    <li>MongoDB for being a database</li>
                    <li><a href='http://cloudflare.com'>Cloud Flare</a> for caching (Thanks for the bandwidth guys!).</li>
                    <li><a href='http://linode.com'>Linode</a> for great hosting.</li>
                    <li>Twitter for building the infrastructure to make this possible, although they are doing a lot of things wrong.</li>
                    <li>My wife for not leaving my despite my a-social single-minded mind while working on this and countless other projects.<li>
                </ul>
