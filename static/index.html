                <h1>Social Gravity</h1>
                <p>Social Gravity is a new way to analyze social networks on twitter. I'm sure it could be useful for marketeers and egomaniacs, but more importantly: it's magical.</p>
                <o>See for yourself:</p>

                <h3>Details</>
                <p>If you've read this far, you should follow me on twitter ;) <a target='_blank' href='http://twitter.com/jtwaleson'>@jtwaleson</a>. After all, I made all this, and it works with twitter. Seriously though, don't do it.</p>
                <h3>How do I ....</h3>
                <p>Click the @ button. Enter a twitter account that is not protected, like @jtwaleson. Leave the settings to default, press Go!</p>
                <p>Your friends will now begin to trickle into the screen. Want to see something cool? Press the <b>start/stop</b> button. Your friends that know eachother will flock together. The result is a 2D representation of your network.</p>
                <p>Want to see something even cooler? Use your <b>scroll</b> wheel on the page. You can zoom in and out.</p>
                <p>More? Ok, <b>drag</b> one of your friends around and see who follows him/her!</p>
                <p>Still more? What about this: press the '?' button. You will see <b>keywords</b> that are being represented in one area.</p>
                <p>No way, there is even more: <b>click a couple of people</b> to see who they are connected to.</p>
                <p>Want to have <b>a contest</b> between two important people in your network? Double click these two persons, this will pin them down on the spot. Then drag them around and see which of them has more traction in your network.</p>
                <h3>Rate limiting? Wtf?</h3>
                <p>Yeah. Twitter is limiting the amount of API requests to 150 per ip per hour. I managed to work around that by letting <b>you</b> do the requests for me and storing the results in a cache. If you still hit a download limit, you should come back in one hour. Cool, but annoying.</p>
                <h3>Why no .....?</h3>
                <p>Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace(hahaha)? Privacy. Those social networks only allow you to see the friends of the current user. It is impossible to see who they in turn are connected to.</p>
                <h3>How did you .....</h3>
                <p>HTML5, AJAX, jQuery, Lots of intelligence, about 20 free evenings spread out over 8 months</p>
                <p>I'd like to thank:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web workers, for relatively smooth UI despite the heavy lifting</li>
                    <li>Javascript/coffeescript/node.js for doing everything</li>
                    <li>MongoDB for being a database</li>
                    <li>JQuery</lI>
                    <li>Caolan McMahon for creating async.js. I use the queue for downloading all the data from Twitter/Cache</li>
                    <li><a href='http://cloudflare.com'>Cloud Flare</a> for caching (Thanks for the bandwidth guys!).</li>
                    <li><a href='http://linode.com'>Linode</a> for great hosting.</li>
                    <li>Twitter for building the infrastructure to make this possible, although they are doing a lot of things wrong.</li>
                    <li>My wife for not leaving my despite my a-social single-minded mind while working on this and countless other projects.</li>
                </ul>
